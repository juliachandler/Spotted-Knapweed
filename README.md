This study was done to investigate how the introduction of five biological control insects (_Larinus minutus_, _Metzneria paucipunctella_, _Urophora affinis_, _Urophora quadrifasciata_ and _Chaetorellia acrolophi_) may have influenced the seed and vegetative properties of spotted knapweed after more than 4 decades of an insect biological control program in the Lundbom Commonage near Merritt, British Columbia, Canada.
